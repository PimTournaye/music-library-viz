### URGENT:
- Rewrite data fetching and organising to only use credits from albums --> identify a way of finding main artists of an album
- Use web workers to improve performance of graph layout algorithm
- Implement zooming and panning for better navigation of the graph
- Add more interactivity, such as highlighting nodes and edges on click or hover

### LESS URGENT:
- Add error handling and feedback to notify users if something goes wrong while fetching or - processing data
- Add a loading indicator to show users that the application is still working while fetching data
- Consider optimizing the graph layout algorithm for better performance on large graphs
- Insert data into graph database

### FUTURE:
- Write tests to ensure the application functions as expected and to catch any regressions during development
- Add filters and search functionality to allow users to explore the graph more easily
